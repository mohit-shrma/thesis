The low-rank matrix completion-based approach is the state-of-the-art collaborative filtering based method used for generating recommendations.
In this chapter, we show that the skewed distribution of ratings in the
user-item rating matrix of real-world datasets affects the accuracy and the 
ranking performance of the matrix completion approach. 
Also, we investigate how does the number of ratings that an item has impacts the ability of
low-rank matrix completion approaches to correctly estimate the ratings for the
item and we show that the prediction accuracy  and ranking performance 
for the item positively correlates with the number of ratings an item has.
