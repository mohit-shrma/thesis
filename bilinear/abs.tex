Recommending new items to existing users has remained a challenging problem
due to the absence of user's past preferences for these items.  
The user personalized non-collaborative methods based on item features 
can be used to address this item \emph{cold-start} problem. 
These methods rely on similarities between the target item and user's previous preferred items. 
While computing similarities based on item features, these
methods overlook the interactions among the features of the items and 
consider them independently. Modeling interactions among features can be helpful 
as some features, when considered together, provide a stronger signal on the 
relevance of an item when compared to case where features are considered independently. 
In this work we introduce the \CFEXP 
(\CF), which learns a \emph{low-rank} user personalized \emph{bilinear} similarity model to
generate \TOPN recommendation of new items. \CF model leverages all available
information across users to model these interactions among features.
Results on benchmark
dataset shows that \CF can improve upon traditional linear collaborative methods for
cold-start \TOPN item recommendation.
