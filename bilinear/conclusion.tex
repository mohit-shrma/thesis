\section{Conclusion} \label{ch:bilinear:conclusion}
We presented here \CF for the personalized cold-start \TOPN item recommendation.
It tries to learn multiple global bilinear similarity functions between items, 
represented by their features, by
using all the information available across users. It captures the
interaction among the item features by using a bilinear model.
The computation complexity of the bilinear model estimation is significantly reduced by
modeling the similarity as sum of the diagonal component and off-diagonal component.
The off-diagonal components are further estimated as dot product of latent spaces of
features. Results on benchmark datasets shows that \CF can improve upon the existing
linear collaborative methods used for the cold-start item recommendation.

In future, we would like to try \CF on
different kinds of transaction datasets. We would also like to see what effects
does the non-negativity constraint on
the model parameters lead to. We will also try \CF on a related but relevant problem
of the actual rating prediction instead of \TOPN recommendation.
