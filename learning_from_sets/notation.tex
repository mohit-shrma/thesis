Throughout the paper, all vectors are column vectors and are represented by
bold lowercase letters (e.g., $\bm{p,q}$). The row vectors are represented by
having the transpose super-script (e.g., $\bm{p^T}$). Matrices are represented by upper
case letters (e.g., ${R,W}$). The ($i$, $j$) entry of matrix $W$ is denoted by
$w_{i,j}$. The \textit{i}th row of matrix $P$ is represented by $\bm{p}_i^T$. We use calligraphic letters to denote sets (e.g.,
$\mathcal{C,D}$), and the size of a set $\mathcal{S}$ is represented by
$|\mathcal{S}|$.
