This chapter focuses on improving the matrix completion-based 
recommendation methods for users and items present in 
the tail, i.e., those having few ratings in the user-item rating matrix.
We show that the performance of matrix completion in real datasets
vary with the number of ratings that a user or an item has, and its accuracy is
 low for the users or the items with few rating.  
Furthermore, we use these insights to develop \emph{\TMF},
a matrix completion-based approach, that outperforms the 
state-of-the-art MF method for the users and the items 
in the tail.
