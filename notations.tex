\chapter{Notations}
\label{ch:notations}


All vectors are represented by bold lower case letters(e.g., $\bf{p}, \bf{q}$). The $i$th component of vector $\bm{p}$ is denoted
by $\bm{p[i]}$. All matrices are represented by upper
case letters (e.g., $R$, $P$). The $i$th row of a matrix $P$  is represented by $\bf{p_i}$. The ($i$, $j$) entry of matrix $W$ is denoted by
$w_{i,j}$.
The predicted rating of user $u$ on item $i$ is denoted by $\hat{r}_{u,i}$.
We use calligraphic letters to denote sets (e.g., $\mathcal{S}$, $\mathcal{T}$), and the size of a set $\mathcal{S}$ is represented by
$|\mathcal{S}|$.

Throughout the paper, all vectors are column vectors and are represented by
bold lowercase letters (e.g., $\bm{p,q}$). The row vectors are represented by
having the transpose super-script (e.g., $\bm{p^T}$). Matrices are represented by upper
case letters (e.g., ${R,W}$). The ($i$, $j$) entry of matrix $W$ is denoted by
$w_{i,j}$. The \textit{i}th row of matrix $P$ is represented by $\bm{p}_i^T$. We use calligraphic letters to denote sets (e.g.,
$\mathcal{C,D}$), and the size of a set $\mathcal{S}$ is represented by
$|\mathcal{S}|$. 
 
 
A predicted value is denoted by having a
$\mathbf{\tilde{}}$ (tilde) over it (e.g., $\tilde {r}$) and an estimated value
is denoted by having a $\mathbf{\hat{}}$ (hat) over it (e.g., $\hat {r}$).

\users and \items are used to denote the sets of users and items, respectively,
whose respective cardinalities are \nusers and \nitems (i.e., $|\users| =
\nusers$ and $|\items| = \nitems$). Matrix \rmat will be used to represent the
user-item feedback/rating matrix of size $\nusers \times \nitems$, i.e., $\rmat
\in \mathds{R}^{\nusers \times \nitems}$. Symbols \usru and \itmi are used to denote
individual users and items, respectively. An entry $(u, i)$ in \rmat, denoted by
\rui, is used to represent the rating on item \itmi by user \usru.
%
For implicit feedback, \rmat is converted to a binary matrix. If the user has
provided feedback for a particular item, then the corresponding entry in \rmat
is $1$, otherwise it is $0$. We will refer to the entries for which the user
has provided feedback as \emph{rated} items and those for which the user has
not provided feedback as \emph{unrated} items.

For quick reference, all the important symbols used, along with
their definition is summarized in \tblref{tbl:notations}.
